excerpt: '
Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is an important parameter for assessing global oxygen usage and guiding clinical interventions. However, measuring ScvO2 requires invasive catheterization. As an alternative, we aim to noninvasively and continuously measure changes in oxygen saturation of the internal jugular vein (SijvO2) by a multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy system. The relation between the measured reflectance and changes in SijvO2 is modeled by Monte Carlo simulations and used to build a prediction model using deep neural networks (DNNs). The prediction model is tested with simulated data to show robustness to individual variations in tissue optical properties. The proposed technique is promising to provide a noninvasive tool for monitoring the stability of brain oxygenation in broad patient populations.'
