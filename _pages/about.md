Hello, I am Chin-Hsuan(Shawn) Sun, a recent graduate from the Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics at National Taiwan University, holding a Master's degree. Throughout my academic journey, I have delved into the intersection of software engineering and biomedical optics, a field that captivates my passion for innovation and problem-solving.

My master's thesis, titled "Accelerating Monte Carlo Simulation through Surrogate Models for Quantifying the Internal Jugular Vein using Artificial Neural Networks," reflects my commitment to advancing research at the cutting edge of technology and biomedical optics. In this project, I explored the integration of computational techniques, leveraging surrogate models and artificial neural networks to enhance the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations. Then, I built a prediction model by utilizing the surrogate model to generate a bunch of diffuse reflectance spectra as dataset for training. Therefore, it shows the ability to quantify the blood oxygen saturation change of internal jugular vein. This work not only showcases my technical proficiency but also underscores my dedication to addressing challenges in the realm of biomedical optics.

I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to leveraging my expertise to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of biomedical engineering and software development.
